# Ontario-Electricity-Forecasting
Electricity is an essential for most markets, making accurate and timely forecasting crucial for certain investment, and business decisions. The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) provides forecasts for Ontario electricity prices; however, improvements are always sought. In this work, we present exploratory data analysis, the theoretical foundation of ARMA models, and the motivations behind their use in this context. We then compare ARMA model forecasts with those of IESO's. The results demonstrate that our ARMA hour-ahead forecasting model achieves a lower mean absolute error than IESO's, while maintaining a quick construction time, and producing residuals that exhibit characteristics of a white noise process.
